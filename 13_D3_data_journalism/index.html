          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The objective of this data analysis was to observe any relationship between United States poverty and income. The data used for this
            analysis included measures of poverty and income for the 50 states along with the U.S. captial, Washington D.C., considered separately.
            </p>

          <p>The hypothesis we are aiming to prove is the negative correlation between state income and poverty. As a state's income increases, it would
            logically follow that poverty would decrease because there in more money in the state. 
            </p>

          <p>Upon graphing state poverty by income, the negative correlation provides strong evidence for the hypothesis. Thus the conclusion is 
            that as state income increase, poverty is expected to decrease. A furture aim could be analysizing other characteristics and demographics of US 
          states to understand why states fall where they do in this correlation. </p>
